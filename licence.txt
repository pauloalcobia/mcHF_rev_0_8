The mcHF project was result of significant time and money invested. I am 
perfectly happy with the project being small time hobby endeavour. Although
it looks like ready for mass production, this is not the intention of it,
but rather to provide fun to the electronics/ham radio enthusiasts. So if you
have grand business ideas, either for the source code or hardware, please 
contact me first to reach some licensing agreement, instead of just doing
quick copy pasta thing and pretend ignorance. I will appreciate it, thanks.
